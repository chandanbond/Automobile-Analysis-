# Project Overview
This project focuses on performing data analysis and insights extraction from an automobile dataset using Apache Hive. The primary goal is to use Hive’s SQL-like capabilities to analyze key automotive trends such as company performance, vehicle distribution, fuel efficiency, and pricing patterns. The project demonstrates how to manage structured automotive data on a Big Data platform (Cloudera/Hadoop) and use HiveQL for analytical querying and decision support.


# Dataset Description
The dataset, automobiles.csv, contains detailed information about various cars, including:
•	Company
•	Model
•	Fuel Type
•	Body Style
•	Horsepower
•	Engine Size
•	Mileage
•	Price
•	Number of Cylinders
•	Drive Type, etc.


# Objectives
The key objectives of this project are:
•	To import and store CSV data into Hive tables efficiently.
•	To perform analytical queries on automobile specifications.
•	To extract business insights like:
o	Most popular car manufacturers.
o	Average car price by fuel type or company.
o	Trends in engine size vs. price.
o	Correlation between horsepower and mileage.
o	Distribution of cars by body style.

# Technologies Used
•	Apache Hive
•	Hadoop (Cloudera environment)
•	HiveQL (SQL-like queries)
•	CSV file data ingestion
•	HDFS storage

# Key Insights
•	Identified top 5 car manufacturers by number of models.
•	Discovered pricing variations across fuel types.
•	Observed the relationship between engine power and fuel efficiency.
•	Highlighted dominant body styles and their market share.

# Conclusion
This project showcases how Apache Hive can be leveraged for large-scale data analysis in the automotive sector. By integrating structured queries with big data tools, analysts can derive meaningful insights that support business intelligence and automotive market research
